            <p>
                I am a computer science student at FEDERAL UNIVERSITY OF TECHNOLOGY MINNA with ICT as my major-field.I love exploring new technologies and often amazed by the progress we as a human species have made so far in the recent years (I've always love to be part of the greatest creators)

            I have started reflecting my ideas and thougths through the medium of words recently so spelling and    grammar mistakes are very often.You can write me back if you spot any and don't want to live anymore</p>
