            <p>Internship at present
I recently have joined the Sidehustle Networks as a Software Developer-Intern in the frontend team. My major part of the work has been into the field of creating sustainable and flexible CI/CD (Continuous Integration and Continuous Development) pipelines which enables developers at Juniper to do rapid development. I am also exploring the role of container technology like Docker and container-orchrastation technologies like K8s, Swarm to create industry standard production environments.</p>
